# Grid Scaler

## How to Use

Once the plugin is loaded a new wrench icon will appear below the main tool selection.

Click on this icon and you will be presented with Six more icons. (Imgur Album - https://imgur.com/a/1UZUjkT)

1. Reset Grid - This will set the grid to 100 pixel square with 0 X/Y offset. It also changes the grid color to pink to make it easier to see for setup. Now works with Hex Grids (**Warning spastic GIFs below**)

2. Auto Adjust Grid - **||Currently Disabled due to issues||** This will let you draw a square on the map then have the grid size and X/Y offsets set to match the drawn square.

3. Set GridSquare Size - This will let you draw a square on the map then have the grid size set to match the drawn square. No offset is applied with this and should be applied manually.

4. Adjust X - When this is selected it will let you move the grid along the X plane. Clicking the button then clicking on a vertical line in one of your grid squares will adjust the grid to line up with that point. Now works with hexes!!

6. Set GridSquare with a 3x3 Square - Draw a 3x3 grid square on the map then have the grid size set to match the drawn square. No offset is applied with this and should be applied manually.

7. Set GridSquare with a Hexagon - Draw hexagon on the map then have the grid size set to match the hex. No offset is applied with this and should be applied manually. Flat/Horizontal Hexes should be drawn left -> right from the midpoint, while Pointed/Vertical Hexes should be drawn from the top down.

It may not be perfect but it will be close. 

## Notes and Mentions

This module was first created by UberV. I'm taking it over to get some bug fixed and possibly add new features in the future.
